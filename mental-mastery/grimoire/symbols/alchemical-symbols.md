# Alchemical symbols

Alchemical symbols have been in use for centuries, if not millennia.&#x20;

They represent things on multiple levels, somewhat metaphorically (although sometimes perhaps the metaphor is too true to really be considered a metaphor).&#x20;

You can communicate and construct ideas using alchemical symbols.&#x20;

Alchemically symbolic descriptions of physical & chemical processes sometimes draw strong analogy to biological, mental, psychological and spiritual processes.&#x20;
