# About symbols

There are different kinds of symbols.

* Things that represent concepts intuitively. (☯️)
* Things that represent concepts metaphorically (but [are not](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] immediately intuitive).
* Things that represent concepts by consensus. (☯️)
* There are also smbols that are intuitive within a specific context. (🔀)

We also have classes of symbols:

* graphic (image, shape, picture)
* sonic (sound)
* lexic (word)
* letric (letter; usually a simple sound with a meaning, then combined into words)
* sigilic (self-composed symbol based on parts taken from the chosen concept)

Sigils are covered in a [separate section](../sigils.md) of the website.

The study of symbols and their histories is part of the study of signs, called _semiotics_.
