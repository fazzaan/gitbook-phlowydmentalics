_We start with commonly-known and widely-used symbols of the world. Apologies for any I may have missed which you think should be here. I am happy to include them if you_ [_<mark style="color:yellow;">contact me</mark>_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] _about it._&#x20;

## Graphic symbols

Many long-standing graphic symbols are encoded in Unicode:&#x20;

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th width="182">Unicode name</th><th width="145">Symbol</th><th width="184">Type</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Yin Yang</td><td>☯️</td><td>Intuitive</td><td>Yin-Yang, balance. Visually represented and derivable.</td></tr><tr><td>Om, Aum</td><td>🕉️</td><td>Consensus</td><td>Aum, original sound of the Universe</td></tr><tr><td>Wheel Of Dharma</td><td>☸️</td><td>Contextually representational</td><td>Dhamma wheel — Eight parts</td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac</td><td>♒♈♉♊♌♎♏♐♑</td><td>Contextually representational</td><td>Each symbol represents the idents. Some Zodiac symbols don't seem to imply their idents.</td></tr><tr><td>Shuffle, Repeat</td><td>🔀🔁</td><td>Contextually intuitive</td><td>In media playback: shuffle, repeat</td></tr><tr><td>Play, Stop, Pause</td><td>▶️⏹️⏸️</td><td>Contextually intuitive</td><td>The <em>Play</em> triangle shows moving forward, thus square <em>Stop</em> implies the movement stopping. The broken square, <em>Pause</em>, suggests a break in movement.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Notice that many emoji graphic publishers even use their own sub-stratum symbolism: in the emoji set on my computer (Windows 11), ideological symbols (like spiritual and religious) have a purple background, while most other generic symbols have a blue background. The generic symbols may be coloured in another way, usually pertaining to cultural projections: e.g. the male symbol ♂️ is blue, while the female symbol ♀️ is pink; and the transgender symbol ⚧️ is purple.&#x20;
