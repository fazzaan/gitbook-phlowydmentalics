# Defining hierarchy of concepts

* spelling — words and letters as meaningful symbols&#x20;
* spelling — furling up data/matter in order(,) for it to unfold —&#x20;
  * physical — charging, compressing etc&#x20;
  * mental — neural, psychic etc
  * temporal — planning, futuring
* habiting — under the acknowledgement that humans are creatures of habit, we can use habit to programme ourselves in growth, direction, choice, response, reaction, action, etc everything. Hence habiting is a magick
  * is habiting a type of spelling, or is spelling a type of habiting? they are non-identical but I cannot figure which is the super and which is the sub. Perhaps they share an intersection instead.&#x20;
