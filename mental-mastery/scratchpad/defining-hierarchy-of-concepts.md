# Defining hierarchy of concepts

* spelling — words and letters as meaningful symbols&#x20;
* spelling — furling up data/matter in order(,) for it to unfold —&#x20;
  * physical — charging, compressing etc&#x20;
  * mental — neural, psychic etc
  * temporal — planning, futuring
* habiting — under the acknowledgement that humans are creatures of habit, we can use habit to programme ourselves in growth, direction, choice, response, reaction, action, etc everything. Hence habiting is a magick
  * is habiting a type of spelling, or is spelling a type of habiting? they are non-identical but I cannot figure which is the super and which is the sub. Perhaps they share an intersection instead.&#x20;
  * from Ryan:&#x20;
    * hmmm, from a phenomenological pov perhaps _habiting_ might be a type of _spelling_, though the spell in question might be unobserved or indirectly observed by the habitor.&#x20;
    * like plants have a habit of growing towards sunlight but while a part of their natural condition do realize it as such (though they might and we just can’t access that level of consciousness to address it at this point in time and understanding)
  * my response:&#x20;
    * So I suppose the next question is, are there any types of spelling that are not habit-forming?
    * Plants do have a/the habit of growing towards sunlight... In what way is that habit stored? Should the concept of habit be expanded from neurology, to encompass cellular responses and epi/genetic habituation?
    * I do quite agree that they \[plants] may well realize and understand and even know, or gnow, what they are doing, and that we cannot comprehend it at present/ever.
    * Perhaps they are a puppetry manifestation into Real coming from a plant consciousness entity beneath/outside of SpaceTime , and are simply extremely resolute about their habits and how to stay alive so they don't deviate.
    * Perhaps all things are puppetry manifestations anyway, plants just be a different subreal entity type/class/creature. I wonder if, in human level anyway, or perhaps animalian brain level, all spelling results in neurological habiting?
