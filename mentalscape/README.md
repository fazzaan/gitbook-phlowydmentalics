everything that you aren't creating, you are consuming

yes, we shall not be identified as consumers

but I am describing it from a purely phenomenological standpoint.

your senses consume light and sound and matter.

these make up your sensory sphere, in turn comprising your percepts.

and your percepts become your memories, models and heuristics of the world.



necessarily, then, your senses shape your world and your psychology.

_**you are what you eat**_
{% endhint %}

and what you see, you eat with your eyes&#x20;

what you hear, you eat with your ears&#x20;

what you consume, you digest with your brain.



So put into your senses only that which is of good & desirable quality.



## To do&#x20;

* choosing media types — films, books, series, and why&#x20;
* choosing genres — scifi & fantasy, and why (vehicle for discussing politics, racism, sexism, discrimination, philosophy, spirituality, cosmology)&#x20;
* choosing quality — e.g. avoiding fictional science, preferring scientific fiction; avoiding nonsensical fantasy, preferring founded and reasonable magic systems
