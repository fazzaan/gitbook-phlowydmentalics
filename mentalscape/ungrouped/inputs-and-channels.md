# Inputs & Channels

inputs from outside the mentalscape

like spirit channelling external concepts into the world

how do these inputs enter?

what are these inputs like?

what are the channels like?

can you craft the channels?

can you designate certain content types to come in or be blocked?

can you decide to only receive that which brings health or trains health?

can you keep the worst out?

remember that destruction is not inherently evil, and that all new creation defends on destruction.
