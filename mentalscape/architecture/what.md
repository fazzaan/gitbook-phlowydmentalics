<summary>comment to a friend asking for suggestions on handling oneself in neurodivergence</summary>

What keeps me on course is that my course is focussed on fighting demons. It's up to you to determine what those demons are and how you want to fight them. It's much easier to keep track of demons than it is to manage a schedule. When managing a schedule becomes a necessary part of fighting the demons, then that too becomes simpler. We are all somewhat plagued by personal and non-personal demons. Fight your own first — and I'm not suggesting that audhd is one of them — and then turn your gaze upon the demons outside. I'm definitely using "demons" loosely here so identify them as anything you see fit.

I am somewhat quest-based, and I've also how to craft my environment to be conducive to rest, focus, productive, relax, seclude, hermit, whatever I need to do. Determine how to craft your spaces and do so as well as you can, then turn your focus onto your quests and demons.

Architecture:

Do you have information to share with people? Concepts to distribute? Habits you want to develop, alter or remove? Systems, skills, knowledge you want to learn?

Consider the architecture that is required in order for these things to happen not just easily but naturally. E.g. a helical tube gyrates water flowing down it, naturally cleansing the water of anything heavy like silt and dust. Think about water, gravity, etc; construct the architecture of your tasks, your spaces, your activities, your life, so that certain things cannot help but come to pass.

***

Also do consider that you may need to engage in more self-care. Rest, recuperate, don't put excessive pressure on yourself. Reduce your expectations of your success, consider what you think "success" even is. Enjoy the calm, enjoy the silence, enjoy the noise, return to your centre.

You may find that the struggles arise internally due to overstimulation and over-exertion.

Try dzogchen meditation. It's kinda a different class of meditation than most. I only practised it intentionally a few times, but it's kinda changed my default brain modality, and I can sorta microdose it any time I need it.

Draw symbols and words on your hand that you want to internalise and entrain into yourself. I've programmed a bunch of stuff into myself by drawing on my hands every day. Drawing carries more repetition than tattooing.

***

Don't force yourself to construct everything in advance. Iteration is acceptable. Start things, do them, craft your architecture, modify it as you go along. Pre-perfection was always a major trap for me and I struggled to get started.
