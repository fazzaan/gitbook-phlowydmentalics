# Shape of building

the shape of a building determines&#x20;

* what can happen in, through and around it,&#x20;
* what can happen _to_ it,&#x20;
* how it withstands external forces&#x20;



Architecture can be:

* a series of chambers, large or small, which each affect something passing through them in a certain way. Think of an engine. Apply engine concept to a building, to thoughts, to water.
