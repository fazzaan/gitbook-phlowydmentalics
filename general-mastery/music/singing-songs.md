# Singing Songs

This is focussed on learning to sing songs from foreign languages and cultures, but you can use the same technique for any song _(_&#x77;ith the sensible exception of _song types that I have no idea about)_.&#x20;

## Melody & Rhythm

First, play the song a lot, in many environments.

Listen to it especially at home and in the shower.

Sing along with the _melody_ only, especially if it is complex or unusual. Just familiarise yourself with the flow of the notes and the melodic shapes that the singer uses.

And focus on the rhythm of the notes in the melody. Notice the typical rhythms. Notice the variations, are there any patterns to how the rhythm mutates? Notice the deviations away from the patterns. Notice any words or notes that are lengthened, notice any pauses. This is especially important if you are learning a song from another language or culture: the melody constructs can be dramatically different between different cultures, especially if the cultures originated from entirely separate substrates.

Second, can you dissect the melody at all?

Perhaps the singer uses little accidental notes sometimes. These are not part of the melody. Notice them and iron them out so that you can grasp the true melody properly. You can add the accidentals back in later, or add your own stylistic changes.&#x20;

## Lyrics

Third, _now that you are familiar with the melody and rhythm_, look at the lyrics.&#x20;

_We are not trying to memorise the lyrics. You can do that in a later phase if you wish._

Lyrics are like detailed decoration. If you try to sing along before you know the melody well enough, you will be creating incorrect neural pathways in your brain for this new song. It is more sensible and efficient to simply avoid making _any_ lyric-related neural pathways until you have the melody and rhythm down[^1].&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that _every_ action you do utilises neural pathways, and the more times you repeat that action, the more reflexive it'll become.&#x20;

You absolutely do _not_ want to create dysfunctional, erroneous reflexes!&#x20;

Thus, it is much better to avoid creating any altogether. Avoid that by ignoring the lyrics until you are ready to sing the lyrics at the correct pitch and rhythm.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Read the lyrics along with the song a few times. Mumble them or say them if you can. If the melody is complicated, don't worry about that for now, just focus on the timing of the words.

In singing, we are allowed to make "frame-drops", because _**the timing is more important than the words**._ In a song, the rhythm is king, if you deviate from it you will confuse everyone else playing with you, everyone singing along, etc. You abide by the rhythm. This is not optional. Thus, <mark style="color:yellow;">if you miss a word,</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark>_<mark style="color:yellow;">you miss that word</mark>_. Do not try to sing it late.&#x20;

We can consider this as equivalent to "real-time computing".&#x20;

Notice which lyrics you struggle to say/sing at the right time. Focus on them, without the music, then with the music. Loop the section in your [music player](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] and slow it down _as much as necessary_ so that you can repeat it correctly, over and over. You'll do this process again for the whole song later when it comes to practising and consolidating your flow.&#x20;

## Pronunciation

Yes, this part gets its own section.

If you think that pronunciation isn't that important, or that it's ok to be "good enough" rather than "I'm always improving to become as good as possible", then read [this article on the importance of clear pronunciation](#user-content-fn-3)[^3].&#x20;

Here, you need to focus on three main aspects:

1. Pronunciation of the words&#x20;
2. Pronunciation of the connections between every word
3. Intonation & emphasis[^4] of each word within its pitch

Intonation in songs in non-tonal languages is usually irrelevant, as the tonation will simply bend to fit the melody. But in tonal languages, sometimes the word tonation is necessary, and sometimes the singer chooses to do it regardless of how important it may be.&#x20;

Some Vietnamese songs â€” usually the more-traditional ones â€” abide by their language's intonation rules. Some tones are pitch-based, some are quality-based; thus, some are harder to include within a melody, while others are simple. In some songs, the pitch of the word's tone _starts_ on pitch of the note in the melody, but in other songs, the tone's pitch _ends_ on the pitch in the melody. And sometimes the tone is abandoned altogether ðŸ˜‚ If you are singing a tonal language, you should probably take some time to master the tones first!&#x20;

### 1. Pronunciation of the words

If you don't already speak the language, go study the IPA for it. If you're not familiar with IPA, go study that too. And also study the IPA of _your own language_ so that you understand where you're starting from and therefore can build a bridge between your own pronunciation model and your target language. The phonemes[^5] in the target language will have different allowable variances than in your own language, so it is vital that you learn which how to pronounce correctly â€” otherwise, your pronunciation variances will sound like you are saying different words!

a) study the IPA of your language&#x20;

b) study the IPA of the target language&#x20;

c) practise pronouncing _accurately_ in the target language&#x20;

d) use your new pronunciation model to practise the lyrics

Always start slowly!

### 2. Pronunciation of the connections

In pronunciation, this is called "connected speech".

<details>

<summary>The Myth of Liaison</summary>

Note that "connected speech" is _**NOT**_ "liaison";&#x20;

Also note that "liaison" does _**NOT**_ exist in English, despite what your teachers may have taught you!&#x20;

In linguistics, "liaison" is _**specifically**_ the pronunciation of usually-silent final _**letters**_, in _**French**_, when the next word begins with a vowel.&#x20;

This is because many final letters in _**Fre**_**nch** are silent as per the rules of _**French phonology**_.&#x20;

In English, in general, final letters are _**not**_ silent under any rules (except for Magic E, which is a totally different situation), and final letters are always pronounced (whether with an audible sound or a cutting of the sound, such as the glottal T). Thus, a word spoken in isolation **already has its final sound pronounced**, so a word spoken _after_ it does not have any direct impact on the pronunciation of that final sound.&#x20;

As a disclaimer, there are certain phonetic circumstances in which something that _seems_ like "liaison" happens, and it is a liaison-like effect, but it is not liaison _per se_.&#x20;

This is actually really important for English learners to understand, because a mis-apprehension of this concept results directly in English learners believing that it is ok to drop the final sound of any or even _every_ word. This may be even worse than we might imagine, because "dropping" a sound means different things in different languages! In English, "dropping" a T or a K means dropping it down to the glottis, while dropping a G refers to pronouncing an âŸ¨ngâŸ© /Å‹/ as only an âŸ¨nâŸ© /n/. But for Vietnamese learners of English, they do not perceive the glottal T (because a glottal stop is part of a _tone_ for them, the _dáº¥u ngÃ£_), so when they "drop" a T, they end up pronouncing an open-ended vowel instead.

**The Myth of Liaison is actually extremely damaging to students in their learning & training.**&#x20;

Start slow, speed it up gradually, reach full speed, then make it _faster_ than full speed. Once you are comfortable saying & singing the lyrics _**faster**_ than the original song goes, you'll be more-than-comfortable singing it at its normal speed.&#x20;
