# Introduction

## Initial thoughts from notebook

* How to activate mastery
* The condition of being a master, a mast-er, a masterer
* The right mentalities to maintain
  * Not doing things up until "good enough" but going further
  * Attempting to do things at a higher level of difficulty
  * Attempting to do common tasks with fluidity and mindfulness, and working out how to do them moreso
* Go deeper in for the details - in creation and observation and practice
* Look at the bigger picture AND the minutiae
* Try to be both more precise and more generalising
* Generalise, recognise stereotypes, but never limit things & people by your expectations
* Activate mindfulness is all movements
* Mental tech - psychological development
* Don't be afraid to make mistakes, even/especially in front of other people. The amount of time spent that you are visible to others is probably high, so that is a large amount of time in which you could be practising & improving.
* Make yourself early for everything. The extra time (time buffers) all around your schedule will decrease stress and increase the time you have for focussing on your practice.
* repeat tasks & routines each time you perform them erroneously, to increase the speed of changing the habit & strengthening the new one
