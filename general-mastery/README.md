We _have_ to get our lives in order.

There is no other option, and nobody else is gonna do it for us.

For the best part of 25â€“30 years, we can roll through life, especially in the more-privileged world. Options come our way, health and energy are available from our body's youthful virility, we go to parties and meet new people, our brains are able to learn easily.

We can be completely unfocussed and still somehow survive.

But things change.&#x20;

We age. Our family ages. Our parents age. Our friends age.

One day we may want children.

**One day our parents, family, siblings, friends, children may need our help.**

_Are we prepared to help them?_

_**Are we even prepared to help ourselves?**_

## To do

### Initial thoughts from notebook

* How to activate mastery
* The condition of being a master, a mast-er, a masterer
* Stepping from training into feeling and _trusting_ the feeling
* The right mentalities to maintain
  * Not doing things up until "good enough" but going further
  * Attempting to do things at a higher level of difficulty
  * Attempting to do common tasks with fluidity and mindfulness, and working out how to do them moreso
* Go deeper in for the details - in creation and observation and practice
* Look at the bigger picture AND the minutiae
* Try to be both more precise and more generalising
* Generalise, recognise stereotypes, but never limit things & people by your expectations
* Activate mindfulness is all movements
* Mental tech - psychological development
* Don't be afraid to make mistakes, even/especially in front of other people. The amount of time spent that you are visible to others is probably high, so that is a large amount of time in which you could be practising & improving.
* Make yourself early for everything. The extra time (time buffers) all around your schedule will decrease stress and increase the time you have for focussing on your practice.
* repeat tasks & routines each time you perform them erroneously, to increase the speed of changing the habit & strengthening the new one

### Other notes

* systems thinking
* extrapolate systemic models and apply those models to other aspects of life; modify the models accordingly and return any modifications back upstream to see if they can be integrated. As the generic model becomes more rounded and stable, you can learn new systems more quickly as similar to the main model but with certain deviations.
