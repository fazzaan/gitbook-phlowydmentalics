# Systematic exploration

using movement as analogy:

dissect movements into basic components

train the simplest components

if the action can be done with two objects/hands/sides at once, practise with only one first.

train everything with each side before moving onto the next aspect, level, complexity.

train in every direction — e.g. forwards, backwards, leftwards, rightwards&#x20;

train in every position — e.g. same side, opposite side, front side, back side, above, below&#x20;

combine the directions and positions&#x20;
