# Qi Gong, Chi Kung, Khi Cong

Qi gong is actual medicine.

Qi gong taps you in to the magnetismical field.&#x20;

Once you get into a flow state inside your qi gong practice, you will feel it.

It is like standing in a pool of water and wafting your arms around you, focussing on the feeling of the water rushing over your skin.

But the water is subtle.&#x20;

The subtle water of the space fabric.

Or perhaps the feeling is not going as deep as the fabric of space itself.

But it feels like pushing through a subtle, ambient magnetic field.

Once you are in the flow of qi gong, you can't un-feel it, and you feel supported by it, the same kind of antigravity to your arms as water imparts.
